# Django Named URL

This project demonstates the usage of named url and its importance in web development




## Lessons Learned

- Use named url in template files via Django templating
- Named urls are a very powerful feature which provides the benefit of referring to the endppoint via name instead of the endpoint string. This helps in reducing redundancy while developing and minimises the chance of bugs if we need to change the endpoint later in the application.
- This project also covers template inheritance concept and shows how to use a base template from which other templates inherits
- This uses function based views
